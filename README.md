## Note on Data  

The data used for this analysis is **dummy data**, created specifically for this project, as actual data from the Qatar 2022 World Cup ticketing system is not publicly available. This dummy data has been designed to closely resemble real-world scenarios and challenges, enabling the demonstration of SQL skills to solve practical business problems.
